# Subset-Sum-Solver


## Problem Description

I was given this problem by Electric Forest. The objective was to sort the camping groups into different sections so that there is minimal overflow into the center firelane. Each group can be placed in any section but not split up.

This is a variation of the subset sum problem which is a common coding interview problem at Google and Amazon.


## Algorithium Description

There is no efficient solution to this problem so the sections were filled by randomly selecting groups while minimizing the area between the longest filled section shortest section.

The sections must be filled from biggest to smallest in order to minimize the variance that results from filling later sections.

The smallest and biggest possible number of groups per section was calculated to limit the number of tries per section.

If the sum of the groups does equal the section area, the allowed error is incrementally increased until it does.

This script repeats the process of finding a solution 10 times. It then chooses the best solution and writes it to a file titled solutions.cvs in the same directory as the script.

The probability of finding the best solution is then

1-(1-P)^n

where P is the probabily of finding the best solution after one run and n is the number of runs.


## Additional Files

Part of the original data I was given is included. The camp leader names were changed to first 2 letters of first name and last name to protect their identities.
The camp leader name was used as the identifier for each group in the python script because some group names had unrecognizable characters.

I wrote and included a VBA to convert the solution to a more excel friendly format. 
The camp leader names can then be index matched to the get the camp group names.

EFF 2018 06-13-18 Group Camp Wk-1 is the final layout of all the camp groups, which was posted to the Electric Forest Facebook page before the festival. Note that a new solution generated by the python script will probably not be the same because the camp groups were randomly choosen to fill sections.
